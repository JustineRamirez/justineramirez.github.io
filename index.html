basics of lipstick; from finishes, to tips for application, all the way to finding out what lipstick shade is right for you! 
And if you're curious, there will be recommendations of brands to purchase your lipstick
from, drugstore or high-end... whichever you prefer. It's in the matter of choice of whether or not you want to add some spice into your life.
