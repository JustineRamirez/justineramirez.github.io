<h2 style="color:purple; font-size: 18px; text-align:center"> Now, I know what you may be thinking: "This is girl is going to be blabbing on about the superficial 
'power' of makeup and how it can 'change a girl's life.'" Hear me out! Every once in a while, us ladies need something to jazz up our look. I've found that with lipstick, one's head is held a smig higher when walking. What's my job? To inform you about the 
basics of lipstick; from finishes, to tips for application, all the way to finding out what lipstick shade is right for you! 
And if you're curious, there will be recommendations of brands to purchase your lipstick
from, drugstore or high-end... whichever you prefer. It's in the matter of choice of whether or not you want to add some spice into your life.
Now follow onto the path of lips. </h2>

<h3 style="color:purple; font-size: 18px; text-align:center"> Hold your wallets, ladies! Before you begin picking which lipstick you want,
you must start with something essential: the lipstick finish. You want to make sure the lipstick you pick has the perfect texture and result
that suits you. There are many lipstick finishes, but here are a few of the basic ones: </h3>
  
  
  <ol> 
  <li style= "text-align: left; color: red; font-family: Tahoma "> Matte </li>
  <p> The infamous matte finish, raved by many. If you are one that prefers less gloss and more longevity, this lipstick finish is for you.
  Matte finishes provide a flat pigment on the lips, leaving little hydration but insane color payoff. </p>
  
  <li style= "text-align: left; color: berry; font-family: Tahoma"> Creamy </li>
  <p> These finshes are the perfect combination of matte and glossy (we'll delve into that one later on). Unlike matte finishes, these
  will be able to give you some of the moisture of a lip balm and the long-lasting pigment of a matte. </p>
  
  <li style= "text-align: left; color: orange; font-family: Tahoma"> Glossy </li>
  <p> </p>
  </ol>
